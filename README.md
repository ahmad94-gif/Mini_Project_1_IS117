Repository = A repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files.
<br>To create a Git repository users are required to follow these steps are :<br>
- Once git is installed go in the directory where the files that require version control are located.<br>
- Type in the terminal "git init" to initialize the file that will contain the references of what need to be saved <br>
- To add all the files in the selected folder to the commit the user will have to type "git add .<br>
- The last step to create a repository is to commit the changes (save all the changes made to the repository), to do that the user will have to type the following: git committ -m "your_commit_name" <br>
