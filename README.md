Repository = A repository is a central file storage location. It is used by version control systems to store multiple versions of files.
<br>To create a Git repository users are required to follow these steps are :<br>
- Once git is installed go in the directory where the files that require version control are located.<br>
- Type in the terminal "git init" to initialize the file that will contain the references of what need to be saved <br>
- To add all the files in the selected folder to the commit the user will have to type "git add .<br>
- The last step to create a repository is to commit the changes (save all the changes made to the repository), to do that the user will have to type the following: git committ -m "your_commit_name" <br>


Clone = git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository
<br>To clone a repository the command needed is "git clone --reference_repository directory_name"
<br>

Fork = A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. <br>

Branch = A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. <br>

Commit = The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.

Merge = Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again.

Checkout = n Git terms, a "checkout" is the act of switching between different versions of a target entity. The git checkout command operates upon three distinct entities: files, commits, and branches.<br>

Push = The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.<br>

Pull = git pull is a Git command used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. <br>

Remote Add / Remove / Show = git-remote - Manage set of tracked repositories.
- Add : Adds a remote named <name> for the repository at <url>
- Remove : Remove the remote named <name>
- Show : Gives some information about the remote <name>.

Status = The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git <br>

Master Branch = Is the main branch created in Git, it contains code that is available for deployment. The master branch should be updated only when sure that the software is working correctly and its free of critical bugs. <br>
